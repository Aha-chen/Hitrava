At the moment, code pull requests will be rejected.

The rationale is as follows:
- I currently don't want to invest time in setting up a proper CLA and the associated agreement procedure.
- I want to leave all possibilities open to be able to distribute Hitrava functionality in other forms or builds, 
maybe under a different license.
 
I thank you for your understanding.
