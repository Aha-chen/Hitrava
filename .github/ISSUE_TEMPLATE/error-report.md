N.B. I won't troubleshoot your Python installation here, only issues with the code. If you're struggling with Python I recommend using [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

**Input**
Tell me what you typed in to produce the error.

**Output**
Tell me what happened when you used the tool.

**Files**
Send me your HiTrack file for me to troubleshoot with.

**Anything else**
Was your run on the moon? Was your run 2 years long? Let me know anything out of the ordinary that might be relevant.
